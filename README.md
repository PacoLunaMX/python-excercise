# Python Excercise

These Python exercises have been carried out with code optimisation in mind, by analysing time complexity. In order to communicate in the best possible way, I have added comments inside the code, which would be necessary during production.

Once the code has been downloaded from the repository and navigated to the main folder:

## Installation
I have used the Pytest library to perform the unit tests for each of the problems, so it is necessary to install it, either in a virtual environment or in the global environment.


```
pip install pytest
```

## Usage
Inside the main file, I programmed the five examples that were given as a reference for both exercises, to see the results of my functions, run:


```
python main.py
```

## Running Tests
Pytest allows us to run all the tests from the terminal directly:


```
pytest
```
